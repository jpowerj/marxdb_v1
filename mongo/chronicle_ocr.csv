Note: There is no record that Liebknecht discussed the title change with M or E, or informed them in advance; but in any case, whether or not he did, M&E made no objection. For Liebknecht, we may conjecture, the title change was motivated by legal considerations, keeping in mind that publication of the Manifesto had heretofore been illegal. By changing the title, the obvious direct link to the old illegal pamphlet was obscured from the eyes of the police, and the reference to an obviously illegal organization (“Communist party"") was dropped. Nevertheless the Volksstaat press, that is, Liebknecht, did not produce a real edn of the offprint pamphlet edn for circulation in Germany. Inside Germany it was the third fascicule that was distributed, in some thousands of copies—sans title, sans preface. The offprint edition—which is historically labeled the 1872 edition—was actually produced in only a few copies plus a batch of a hundred sent to E himself, who apparently remained unaware of this detail. E sent copies of this edn around Europe, in response to requests, as a model for foreign edns and reprints, etc. Thus this ghost-edition became the progenitor of many real ones (cf ST/2). ously ascribed to M in ST/27—cf #M346).",1538,checked,,"Group Meeting,Publication Logistics",Jung_Hermann,IWMA,Bakunin_Mikhail,,,,,Communist Manifesto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
