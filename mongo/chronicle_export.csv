The Imperial Ministry of Justice instructs the Cologne prosecutor’s office to institute proceedings against the Comm of Public Safety (cf #ME30), also against the Demo Assoc and Workers Assoc as well as NRZ. Public Prosecutor Hecker is investigating participants in the Worringen meeting of Sep 17 (see NRZ article of Sep 26, #ME124). In the morning the police arrest Schapper and Becker; they seize Moll and Wächter but are forced to release them by the assembled crowd; they fail to find W. Wolff and E (cf #ME41,15). The Second Rhenish Democratic Congress fails to open as scheduled because of the arrests, but M does come to the hall. At 1 p.m. a mass meeting in the Altenmarkt (Old Marketplace) is opened by Imandt, chaired by W. Wolff. M speaks to a Workers Assoc meeting in the Gasthaus Im Kranz, warning against police provocations to isolated actions; the moment for an armed uprising has not yet come; a premature action would end in a putsch, which would rob the working class of its fighting strength for the decisive day. In the afternoon there is a joint meeting of the Demo Assoc and Workers Assoc in the Eisersche Saal; M and his supporters again warn against premature actions. In face of threatened arrest, E, Dronke, W. Wolff, and F. Wolff leave Cologne. Prussian troops start to move into the city. A workers’ meeting in the Altenmarkt disperses, and some begin building barricades. The Prussian commander decides to wait for daylight before attacking.

Jung is assigned to write the reply (which is errone- third fascicule); it contains the new preface by M&E. It is this offprint which for the first time bears the title Das kommunistische Manifest.   Note: There is no record that Liebknecht discussed the title change with M or E, or informed them in advance; but in any case, whether or not he did, M&E made no objection. For Liebknecht, we may conjecture, the title change was motivated by legal considerations, keeping in mind that publication of the Manifesto had heretofore been illegal. By changing the title, the obvious direct link to the old illegal pamphlet was obscured from the eyes of the police, and the reference to an obviously illegal organization (“Communist party"") was dropped. Nevertheless the Volksstaat press, that is, Liebknecht, did not produce a real edn of the offprint pamphlet edn for circulation in Germany. Inside Germany it was the third fascicule that was distributed, in some thousands of copies—sans title, sans preface. The offprint edition—which is historically labeled the 1872 edition—was actually produced in only a few copies plus a batch of a hundred sent to E himself, who apparently remained unaware of this detail. E sent copies of this edn around Europe, in response to requests, as a model for foreign edns and reprints, etc. Thus this ghost-edition became the progenitor of many real ones (cf ST/2). ously ascribed to M in ST/27—cf #M346)."

If we avoid bloodletting now, then ""in three years, we can win over the rural workers, Prussia’s main prop, and then—fire!"" (letter to Laura Lafargue, Mar 14). The Prussian generals must be eager to precipitate a massacre in order to put us out of action, ""So if our party apparently adopts a somewhat peaceful attitude in Germany in the near future . . . you know the reasons"" (letter to Sorge, Apr 12). But to Liebknecht, who is making speeches ""against violence in any form and under all circumstances,” E writes (Mar 9) that he is wrong and moreover ""no opponent will believe this—they are not that stupid”; what is correct is “that for now we have to behave as peacefully and legally as possible"" and avoid any pretext for a premature collision."
