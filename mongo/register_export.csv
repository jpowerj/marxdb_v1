(Tr) Since 1888 all pubd English edns— with two exceptions noted below—have been based on the “authorized English translation"" of Moore-Engels, which has been repr’d innumerable times. For editions up to 1918 an exhaustive bibliography is offered by Andréas (ST/2). Editions vary according to the value and interest of accompanying material, such as the seven M/E prefaces. In this respect one of the fullest is the Struik edn (ST/ME9). Also, different editions are variously edited for style in punctuation, spelling, and other technical features, including the choice of title (CM or M of the CP). —MECW 6:477 presents the 1888 ""authorized English translation"" with copious footnotes on variations from the original German (but not complete); MEGA also offered a list of these variations, even less completely. ME:SW 1:98 also gives the same version, plus some notes by E to the 1890 German edn, but without other apparatus; it includes all the prefaces except the English edition preface of 1888. —The Manifesto has been kept abundantly in print, under a succession of imprint dates, by a number of left-wing publishers: NYLNCo (SLP) since 1890 up to 1902 for edns made from its original plates, and then 1903 on; Kerr, 1902-1911 (for original plates) and 1912 on; International Pub and M. Lawrence (CPC edns) from ca. 1932 on; Moscow’s FLPH from ca. 1954 on, and Prog Pub more recently; Peking’s Foreign Languages Press from 1965 on; Pathfinder Press (intro by Trotsky), 1970. —Special editions have been kept in print by others: the SPGB (London) pubd a 1948 edn, The Communist Manifesto, and the Last Hundred Years: Monthly Review Press pubd it with #E620 plus an essay (ST/ME13); an edn outfitted with an essay by H. J. Laski has appeared in various versions (see ST/42). — Since the Manifesto began appearing on college reading lists, various commercial editions have multiplied, often accompanied by decontaminating intros: by Penguin (Pelican Bks), 1967, intro by A.

Since 1888 there have been two. —By Eden and Cedar Paul, first pubd as Manifesto of the Communist Party, London, Modern Books; NY: Workers Lib Pub, 1929; then in the edn of the Manifesto ed by Ryazanov, 1930 (see ST/ ME14), where a note states that the trans was ""made in 1928 for Martin Lawrence."" —By Lily G.

For editions up to 1918 an exhaustive bibliography is offered by Andréas (ST/2). Editions vary according to the value and interest of accompanying material, such as the seven M/E prefaces. In this respect one of the fullest is the Struik edn (ST/ME9). Also, different editions are variously edited for style in punctuation, spelling, and other technical features, including the choice of title (CM or M of the CP). —MECW 6:477 presents the 1888 ""authorized English translation"" with copious footnotes on variations from the original German (but not complete); MEGA also offered a list of these variations, even less completely. ME:SW 1:98 also gives the same version, plus some notes by E to the 1890 German edn, but without other apparatus; it includes all the prefaces except the English edition preface of 1888. —The Manifesto has been kept abundantly in print, under a succession of imprint dates, by a number of left-wing publishers: NYLNCo (SLP) since 1890 up to 1902 for edns made from its original plates, and then 1903 on; Kerr, 1902-1911 (for original plates) and 1912 on; International Pub and M. Lawrence (CPC edns) from ca. 1932 on; Moscow’s FLPH from ca. 1954 on, and Prog Pub more recently; Peking’s Foreign Languages Press from 1965 on; Pathfinder Press (intro by Trotsky), 1970. —Special editions have been kept in print by others: the SPGB (London) pubd a 1948 edn, The Communist Manifesto, and the Last Hundred Years: Monthly Review Press pubd it with #E620 plus an essay (ST/ME13); an edn outfitted with an essay by H. J. Laski has appeared in various versions (see ST/42). — Since the Manifesto began appearing on college reading lists, various commercial editions have multiplied, often accompanied by decontaminating intros: by Penguin (Pelican Bks), 1967, intro by A. J. P. Taylor; Regnery, 1955, © 1954, Gateway edn, intro by S. T. Possony; Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1955, ed by S. H. Beer; Washington Square Press, 1964, intro by F. B.
